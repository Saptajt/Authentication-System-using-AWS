This project showcases a robust full-stack application, combining the power of React.js on the frontend and JavaScript on the backend, seamlessly integrating with AWS Cloud servers. The application revolves around a secure and user-centric experience, starting with a login page that ensures access to the application's contents and features only after successful authentication.

To enhance security and user privacy, the application employs various techniques. It implements JavaScript tokens that automatically log out the user after a specified period of inactivity, promoting a proactive approach to safeguarding sensitive information. Furthermore, the application utilizes bcrypt, a powerful encryption algorithm, to securely encrypt and decrypt user passwords. By leveraging the cloud storage capabilities, the encrypted passwords are safely stored, offering peace of mind to users.

This full-stack application not only prioritizes security but also focuses on delivering a smooth and efficient user experience. By combining the capabilities of React.js and JavaScript, it enables seamless communication between the frontend and backend, facilitating efficient data transfer to and from AWS Cloud servers.
